## Getting Started

> **Note for Windows users:**  
> Make sure to open your Ubuntu (WSL) terminal before running the following commands.  
> All setup and `flask run` commands should be executed inside your Ubuntu (WSL) environment, not in Windows CMD or PowerShell.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)

---

> **ðŸ”¥ Hot Tip:**  
> For best results and to avoid Python system errors, always use a virtual environment for your project dependencies.  
> This is now required on modern Ubuntu/WSL.
>
> **First time only (if not already installed):**
> ```sh
> sudo apt update
> sudo apt install python3-venv
> ```
> **Then, for every new project or fresh clone:**
> ```sh
> python3 -m venv venv
> source venv/bin/activate
> pip install -r requirements.txt
> ```
> Your `venv/` folder is local!
> After cloning a new repo, always create and activate a new virtual environment, then install dependencies.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/OZfoody.git
    cd OZfoody
    ```

2. **(Recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```sh
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set up the database:**
    ```sh
    flask db upgrade
    ```

5. **(Optional) Load demo users and posts:**
    ```sh
    python demo/seed_demo_data.py
    ```
    This will create several demo users and posts. You can log in as any demo user, view their posts, share posts, and make friends with other demo accounts.

6. **(Optional) Clean demo data before closing or for a fresh start:**
    ```sh
    python demo/clean_demo_data.py
    ```
    This will remove all demo users and their posts.

7. **Run the app:**
    ```sh
    flask run
    ```
