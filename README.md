## Getting Started

> **Note for Windows users:**  
> Make sure to open your Ubuntu (WSL) terminal before running the following commands.  
> All setup and `flask run` commands should be executed inside your Ubuntu (WSL) environment, not in Windows CMD or PowerShell.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)

---

> **ðŸ”¥ Hot Tip:**  
> For best results and to avoid Python system errors, always use a virtual environment for your project dependencies.  
> This is now required on modern Ubuntu/WSL.
>
> **First time only (if not already installed):**
> ```sh
> sudo apt update
> sudo apt install python3-venv
> ```
> **Then, for every new project or fresh clone:**
> ```sh
> python3 -m venv venv
> source venv/bin/activate
> pip install -r requirements.txt
> ```
> Your `venv/` folder is local!
> After cloning a new repo, always create and activate a new virtual environment, then install dependencies.
> 
> **IDE Tip:**  
> After creating and activating your virtual environment, make sure your code editor (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm) is using the Python interpreter from your `venv` folder.  
> In VS Code, open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`), search for `Python: Select Interpreter`, and choose the one from your project's `venv` directory.  
> This ensures all installed packages are recognized and avoids import errors.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/IanO7/CITS3403-Group-Project.git
    cd OZfoody
    ```

2. **(Recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```sh
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set up the database:**
    ```sh
    flask db upgrade
    ```

5. **(Optional) Load demo users and posts:**
    ```sh
    python demo/seed_demo_data.py
    ```
    This will create several demo users and posts. You can log in as any demo user, view their posts, share posts, and make friends with other demo accounts.

6. **(Optional) Clean demo data before closing or for a fresh start:**
    ```sh
    python demo/clean_demo_data.py
    ```
    This will remove all demo users and their posts.

7. **Run the app:**
    ```sh
    flask run
    ```

## Selenium Testing

Automated UI tests are provided using Selenium IDE and Python scripts.

**To run Selenium tests:**

1. **Always clean and reseed demo data before running Selenium tests:**
    ```sh
    python demo/clean_demo_data.py
    python demo/seed_demo_data.py
    ```

2. **Start the Flask app:**
    ```sh
    flask run
    ```

3. **Open Selenium IDE** (install from [selenium.dev](https://www.selenium.dev/selenium-ide/)).

4. **Open the `CITS3403 Group Project.side` test file** provided in the repo.

5. **Run all tests** in Selenium IDE.

- If you want to repeat the tests, always clean and reseed demo data first, as some tests (like password change) will permanently alter the database.

- Python-based Selenium test scripts and reports are also included in the repo for reference.
